                    <p>This hands-on, one-day course will introduce you to Python, a popular and powerful computer language. You will learn the basics of working with Python through the popular Jupyter system.

                    <p>But Don't Panic - this course is designed for those with no existing coding experience.

                    <h4 class="h3">The basics of programming with Python and Jupyter notebooks</h4>
                    <p>The majority of the course is aimed to take you from zero to hero! We introduce you to Python and Jupyter and take you from the very basics through to writing simple functions. This will involve short tutorials alternated with practical and relevant exercises - all done through live coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the first half of the course we cover variables, data types, lists, loops and conditionals. Don't worry it will all become clear the course and we also cover built-in and on-line documentation should you need other resources.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="h3">Plotting and statistics in Python</h4>
                    <p>In the second part, we showcase some practical applications of Python. By introducing important modules (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas and Seaborn) we cover how to read in datasets and carry out simple plotting and statistics.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to the limited time for the course, this part is done as a “show and tell” where we demonstrate some of the more powerful things that Python can do and provide you the resources (notebooks and videos) to go away and explore these after the course. Should you wish to explore these topics further we also offer a follow-on course: <a href="/courses/data_exploration.html">Analysing and Visualising Data with Python for Biologists</a>.

                <p>Students (at any level) and researchers at any career stage in biology and related areas of science and medicine.
                </p>
                <p>No previous coding experience is needed or assumed.

                <p>If you already have some experience programming in any language then please read <a class="smoothscroll" href="#course-content">What does the course cover?</a> section carefully - the course starts from programming basics  (variables, conditionals, loops, etc.) and you may find our <a href="/courses/data_exploration.html">Analysing and Visualising Data with Python for Biologists</a> course to be more appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>Attendees usually work on their own laptops and are expected to install some programmes before the course. Any laptop or operating system is suitable.

                <p>Attendees should be comfortable installing applications on their own laptops and will be required to do so before the course, details of which will be provided closer to the time. Any laptop or operating system is suitable.
